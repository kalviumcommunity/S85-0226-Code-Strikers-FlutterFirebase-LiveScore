## 🧠 Reflection

Through this task, I learned:

- Flutter uses a widget-based architecture.
- Everything in Flutter is a widget.
- StatefulWidget allows dynamic UI updates.
- Dart syntax is clean and similar to Java/JavaScript.
- Proper folder structuring improves scalability and code maintainability.

This foundation will help in building complex, real-time UI components in future sprints.
